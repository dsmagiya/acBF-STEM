# acBF-aberration-corrected-bright-field-STEM
The repository hosts the code for aberration-corrected bright-field (acBF-STEM) imaging and python scripts to reproduce figures in manuscript "Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging". 

Start with acBF_walkthrough.ipynb, which reproduces Figure 5 (data source: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10058870).

This acBF code uses py4DSTEM as a preparatory step to estiamte the shifts and the aberration function.

CIF file(s) to reproduce Figure 4 and 7 are included in folder "CIFs".
